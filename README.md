## 📖 Client Background & Context
The Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) is a historic British financial institution and a key subsidiary of the NatWest Group, serving millions of personal and business customers. As a legacy bank transitioning into the digital era, it manages vast datasets across mortgages, credit cards, and current accounts.

**The Scenario:**
The Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) is navigating a "perfect storm" in the UK banking sector. Post-pandemic inflation has squeezed household disposable income, leading to higher default rates on mortgages. Simultaneously, digital-first "Challenger Banks" (**Monzo, Revolut**) are aggressively acquiring market share from legacy banks, specifically targeting the profitable "Young Professional" demographic.

**The Business Problem:**
RBS leadership identified two critical financial bleeds:
1.  **Credit Risk:** A rising concentration of Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) in the North West region.
2.  **Digital Churn:** A "Silent Migration" where customers retain RBS mortgages but move primary daily transaction activity to competitors.

    *   Pinpointed the **"Young Professional"** and **"Family"** segments as the primary source of capital migrating to **Monzo** and **Revolut**.
*   **What is the 'Sticky Product' vs. 'Daily Spend' correlation?**
    *   Quantified that only **11%** of customers remain true "RBS Loyalists," showing high churn in primary transaction activity despite retaining large mortgage balances.

## 🗂 Data Structure & Modelling
To enable high-performance filtering over 2.5 million transaction rows, I designed a **Star Schema** data model in Power BI.

*   **`Monthly_Activity_R` (Fact Table):** The core transactional table containing monthly spend, missed payment flags, and primary banking app usage.
*   **`Customer_R` (Dimension):** Static demographics including Age, Region, Segment, and Credit Score.
*   **`Loan_R` (Dimension):** Loan specifics including LTV Ratio, Product Type (Mortgage, Credit Card), and Origination Date.
*   **`waterfall_categories` (Helper):** A disconnected table used to structure the financial "Walk" chart.

## 🖼️ Dashboard Deep Dive

### 1. Executive Home: The Strategic Pulse
A high-level health check of the £199M portfolio designed for the C-Suite.
![Executive Dashboard](Screenshots/1. RBS%20Strategic%20Monitor.png)
*   **KPI Ticker:** Immediate visibility on Total Exposure, Active Customers, and the alarming 28.6% Risk Rate.
*   **Primary Bank Market Share (Ribbon Chart):** Visualizes the loss of market dominance. The **Blue Band (RBS)** narrows significantly from 2023 to 2025, while **Orange (Monzo)** expands, indicating a loss of "Share of Wallet."
*   **Missed Payment Trend (Line Chart):** A time-series analysis showing the volatility of financial stress. The upward trend in 2024-2025 correlates with the inflation crisis.

### 2. Credit Risk Audit: The "Forensic" View
Deep-dive into High-LTV mortgages using a Quadrant Analysis.

*   **Risk Quadrant (Scatter Plot):** A custom quadrant analysis using DAX.
    *   **Navy Dots:** Safe customers.
    *   **Orange Dots (The "Danger Zone"):** Customers with **LTV > 90%** AND **Credit Score < 650**. These are the priority targets for intervention.
*   **Portfolio Value Walk (Waterfall):** Reconciles the loan book movement. It visually proves that despite new business (Green), the portfolio growth is being stifled by stalled repayments (Red) and write-offs.

### 3. Digital Migration
Tracking the flow of capital from RBS to Competitors.

*   **Capital Flight Analysis (Decomposition Tree):** A Root Cause Analysis of the £818K leaving RBS.
    *   **Insight:** The majority flows to **Monzo**, driven specifically by the **"Family"** and **"Young Professional"** segments.
*   **The Retention Funnel:** A stark look at loyalty. Out of 1999 customers, only **220 (11%)** remain "RBS Loyalists" (using RBS for primary banking) in 2025.

## 💡 Strategic Recommendations

### 1. Risk Mitigation: The "Mortgage Holiday"
*   **Finding:** 28.6% of the portfolio is in the "High Risk" quadrant (Orange Zone).
*   **Recommendation:** Launch a **"Mortgage Holiday" Scheme** specifically for North West customers with LTV > 90%.
*   **Impact:** Offer a 3-month interest-only period to alleviate short-term cash flow pressure, preventing full default.

### 2. Product Strategy: Closing the Feature Gap
*   **Finding:** Young Professionals are moving money to Monzo for "Savings Pots" and "Instant Notifications."
*   **Recommendation:** Fast-track the **"RBS Spaces" (Savings Pots)** feature sprint.
*   **Impact:** Strategy targeted to close the feature gap driving migration, aiming to recover the **£15M annual transaction loss**.

## 🧠 Assumptions & Future Scope

### Assumptions made during analysis:
1.  **Risk Definition:** "High Risk" is strictly defined as LTV > 90% AND Credit Score < 650. In a live environment, this would be adjusted based on the bank's Risk Appetite Framework.
2.  **Churn Definition:** A customer is considered "Churned" if their `Primary_Bank` changes from RBS to a competitor for 3 consecutive months.
3.  **Waterfall Calculation:** Due to archived transaction logs, Repayments were calculated as the residual value of `(Open + New - WriteOffs) - Closing Balance`.

### Future Scope (Next Steps):
*   **Predictive Modelling:** Implement a Machine Learning model to predict *which* specific customers will churn in the next 30 days based on transaction behavior.
*   **Real-time Alerts:** Set up Power BI Data Alerts to notify Relationship Managers immediately when a High-Net-Worth client misses a payment.

## 🛠 Technical Implementation & Expertise

### Advanced DAX
*   **Risk Quadrant Logic:** Dynamic coloring of scatter points based on selected LTV and Credit Score thresholds.
*   **Waterfall Logic:** Implemented a complex `SWITCH` measure to map disconnected table categories (Opening, New, Repayments, Closing) into a financial walk.
*   **Churn Analysis:** Used `KEEPFILTERS` to calculate outbound money flow while excluding internal transfers.

### SQL Validation
SQL was used to validate data integrity (checking for NULL LTVs), standardize region names, and bucket risk tiers before importing into Power BI.
